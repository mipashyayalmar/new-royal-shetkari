Gross Margin / P&L report.

gross_margin_report() -- what it calculates:
  Revenue            = sum of Payment rows for closed orders in period
  GST collected      = sum of Order.gst_total
  Net revenue        = Revenue - GST
  Discounts given    = sum of Order.discount_total
  COGS               = sum over sold OrderItems of
                       (item.quantity × recipe.quantity_required × inventory_item.cost_price),
                       computed per menu item by cogs.item_cogs_map().
                       NOTE: only items WITH linked recipes/modifiers contribute.
                       Items without either show COGS = 0 (unknown cost) --
                       see recipe_coverage_pct / cogs_note.
  Gross profit       = Net revenue - COGS
  Gross margin %     = (Gross profit / Net revenue) × 100

net_profit_report() -- gross_margin_report() plus finance.models.Expense for
the period, giving a real net profit number (Gross profit - operating
expenses). Gated behind the "advanced_reports" feature flag, since it needs
a tenant to actually be entering expenses for the number to mean anything.
