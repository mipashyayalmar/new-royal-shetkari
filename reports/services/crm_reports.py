# reports/services/crm_reports.py
"""
CRM/loyalty analytics -- repeat-customer rate, loyalty point trend, and
guest feedback trend. Guest/LoyaltyTransaction data is captured; none of it
was ever aggregated into a report before this.

Schema note: Guest and LoyaltyTransaction have no outlet field (crm/models.py
-- the loyalty program is tenant-wide, not per-outlet, in this schema), so
repeat rate and the loyalty trend are always tenant-wide regardless of the
outlet filter passed in. GuestFeedback DOES have an outlet field and is
filtered accordingly. This is a real schema constraint, not an oversight --
noted here and in the report template rather than silently ignored.
