# inventory/unit_conversion.py
"""
Unit conversion between the small set of units Rasova tracks inventory in.

Recipe, ModifierRecipe, RequisitionItem and BatchItem each store their own
`unit`, independent of the InventoryItem they reference. Nothing used to
convert between them — a recipe entered in grams against an item tracked in
kilograms was silently treated as a raw number, off by a factor of 1000.
This module is the single place that conversion happens, so every stock
deduction/addition path uses the same rules instead of each re-deriving them.
