    """
    Queued receipt/KOT print job consumed by the Rasova Agent in polling mode.

    The browser pushes a job here (HTTPS POST to EC2).
    The agent running on the local device polls /orders/agent/jobs/ (its key in the
    X-Agent-Key header) every 2 s,
    prints to the local printer over TCP 9100, then marks the job done.

    This architecture means the agent never needs an open port or inbound connection —
    it only makes outbound HTTP calls, so Android battery optimisers and NAT routers
    cannot break the connection.

    Moved here from orders/models.py (Phase 1 of the orders app split) via a
    state-only migration -- the underlying table is still named orders_printjob
    (see Meta.db_table below), so this move touched zero rows and required
    zero downtime.
