# SHIM - this file is kept for backwards compatibility.
# All logic has been moved to focused sub-modules:
#   billing_core.py   - billing_view, bill_view
#   payment_views.py  - pay_order, split_pay, refund_payment
#   discount_views.py - apply_discount, make_item_complimentary,
#                       apply_item_discount, log_bypass
#   print_views.py    - generate_bill, print_bill_action, print_kot_action,
#                       printer_status, download_pdf_bill
#
# create_order lives here because it spans billing + order creation concerns
# and is still imported directly from this module by orders/urls.py.
