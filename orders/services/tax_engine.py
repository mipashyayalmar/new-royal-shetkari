"""
The tax engine: turns a bill's lines into every money figure the bill shows
and every tax figure the returns need. It is the only place Rasova does tax
maths. Order.recalculate_totals() runs it and stores what it returns (the
money fields, and the bill's tax record in Order.tax_summary); bills,
receipts, reports and returns read those. The carts' browser copy
(static/js/cart_tax.js) follows the same rules and is checked against this
module in CI.

Pure Python and Decimal: no database and no Django, so every rule can be
tested on its own.

The rules
---------
A bill is a list of lines: dishes, and charges such as the parcel charge.
Each line has an amount as the outlet prices it, a tax kind ("gst", or
"vat" for liquor under the liquor_vat feature; None for a line outside any
tax), a rate in percent, and whether its tax is already inside its price.
An outlet chooses that separately for GST and for VAT, because many bars
price food with tax added and drinks with tax included.

1. Discounts. A dish's own discount comes off first, then its offer (the
   rupees an offer such as "buy 2, get 1 free" takes off it: offers/engine.py;
   a dish with its own discount never gets an offer, so the two don't meet).
   The order discount (a percentage of the dishes after their own discounts
   and offers, or a flat amount) is then spread over all the dishes, food and
   liquor alike, in proportion to their value. Charges are never discounted.
   The discount never exceeds the dishes' value; offers count in it.
2. Tax on each line, exactly (nothing rounded yet): on top of the line's
   value when its price excludes tax (value x rate / 100), or inside it
   when its price includes tax (value x rate / (100 + rate)). An outlet on
   the composition scheme collects no GST, and neither does one that is not
   registered for GST (no GSTIN): only a registered business may collect it
   (CGST Act, section 32). Nor does a registered restaurant on an order
   taken through Zomato, Swiggy or another e-commerce operator: since
   1 January 2022 the operator charges and pays the GST on restaurant
   service supplied through it (section 9(5)), so the restaurant's bill
   carries none and it reports the value in GSTR-1 Table 14. Liquor VAT is
   not GST. The bill records which of the four it was totalled under, its
   scheme: "regular" (a tax invoice), "composition" (a bill of supply),
   "unregistered" or "operator" (GST paid by the e-commerce operator).
3. The dishes' tax of each kind is the exact sum over them, rounded once to
   the paisa, half up. This is how Rasova has always totalled GST, so no
   bill's total changed when the engine arrived. Each charge's tax is
   rounded on its own, so adding a charge never moves the dishes' figures.
   The bill's tax of a kind is the dishes' plus the charges'.
4. The per-rate rows (the bill's tax breakdown, and every return) add up to
   exactly those totals. The dishes' rounded tax is allocated back to them:
   each dish's exact figure is rounded down to the paisa, and the paise
   still owed go to the largest remainders (ties: the larger figure first,
   then line order). Each dish's value after discounts is allocated the same
   way, to the bill's value after discounts. CGST is half the GST rounded
   half up and SGST the rest; each row's CGST is allocated the same way, so
   the rows add up to both. Each kind also gets a section: its dishes' menu
   value, their share of the discount, their taxable value and their tax,
   which is how a bill shows food and liquor apart.
5. The guest pays the dishes after discounts, plus the tax of every line
   priced without it, plus the charges. That is rounded to the rupee, half
   up; the difference is the round-off. So taxable value plus tax, over
   every section and taxed charge, plus any untaxed charge and the
   round-off, is always exactly the grand total.

The expressions in _dish_figures() and compute() deliberately match the
maths of the bills totalled before the engine, digit for digit: the golden
bills in orders/tests/golden/ hold it to that.
