"""
Who may give how much away, and the reason they must leave.

Every way staff can take money off a bill goes through here: a bill
discount (bill screen or the order API), a dish discount (bill screen or a
cart line), and making a dish free. A promo is not one of them: the owner or
a manager set it up in advance, so it needs no reason and no limit.

  * A manual discount needs a reason (it goes on the discount audit report).
  * A cashier or captain may give at most the outlet's staff discount limit,
    as a percent of the bill; a free dish counts as 100%. Above it, a
    manager or the owner has to apply it. With no limit set (the default)
    nothing changes from before: their authority stays uncapped, as agreed
    when the captain role was added.
