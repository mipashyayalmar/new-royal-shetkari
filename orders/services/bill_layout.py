"""
What a bill says about money, line by line: one layout for every bill
Rasova shows a guest (the printed bill and split-bill slip, the thermal and
A4 web bills and their PDF, and the WhatsApp bill link).

Every figure comes from the bill's tax record (Order.tax_summary, written by
orders/services/tax_engine.py), never from today's outlet settings, so an
issued bill never rewords itself. The renderers only draw what this returns.

The rows add up. Read top to bottom, a guest or an inspector gets the total:

    Subtotal        the dishes at menu prices (a free dish shows at 0)
    Offers          minus what offers took off (buy 2 get 1, happy hour);
                    each dish an offer touched names it under the dish
    Discount        minus every other discount, a dish's own and the bill's
    CGST / SGST     by rate, when the price excludes GST (tax added on top)
    VAT             by rate, when the price excludes VAT
    Parcel charge   as billed; its GST is in the rows above
    Round off
    = TOTAL

When the prices include a tax, that tax is already inside the subtotal, so
it is not a row: it is shown under the total as "included", with the
taxable value, so the bill still states the rate and amount of tax a tax
invoice must (CGST Rules, rule 46). Printing it as a row as well, after a
subtotal that was already the taxable value, is what made the old bills
not add up (927 + 108 - 115 is not 1035).

A composition outlet's bill is a bill of supply and says it can't collect
tax (rule 49); an outlet without a GSTIN issues a plain bill. So does an
order through Zomato or Swiggy, which says the app pays its GST: the app
charges it and issues the guest's tax invoice (CGST Act, section 9(5)).
