"""
The two scheduled jobs behind Rasova's own subscription billing.
Both registered in CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE (core/settings.py).

Each per-tenant iteration is wrapped in try/except so one tenant's failure
(bad phone number, Razorpay API hiccup, bounced email) never blocks the
rest of the batch -- same "never raises" philosophy as
notifications/services/whatsapp_service.py.
