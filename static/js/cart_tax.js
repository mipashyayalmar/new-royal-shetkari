/*
 * What a cart will cost, before the order exists: the browser copy of the tax
 * engine (orders/services/tax_engine.py), for the carts on the POS, the QSR
 * counter and the QR menu. The bill itself is always totalled on the server;
 * this has to show the same figures first, so it follows the engine's rules
 * for a cart (carts have no staff discounts; an offer, worked out by
 * static/js/offers.js, comes off its line before tax, as on the bill):
 *   - each line at its own kind of tax and rate: GST, or VAT for liquor;
 *     a 0% line stays 0%
 *   - tax added on top when prices exclude it, inside the price when they
 *     include it, chosen separately for GST and for VAT; an outlet on the
 *     composition scheme collects no GST, nor does one without a GSTIN,
 *     nor an order through Zomato or Swiggy, whose app pays the GST
 *     (VAT is not GST)
 *   - each kind's tax on the dishes is added up exactly and rounded once to
 *     the paisa, half up; the parcel charge is taxed at its own GST rate and
 *     rounded on its own
 *   - the total is rounded to the rupee, half up
 * It counts in whole paise, and rates in basis points (so 5.5% is exact),
 * which makes its rounding come out as the server's does.
 *
 * RasovaCartTax.totals(lines, outlet)
 *   lines:  [{amount: price x quantity in rupees, kind: "gst" | "vat", rate: percent,
 *             offer: rupees an offer takes off it (optional)}]
 *           ({amount, gstRate} is still read as a GST line)
 *   outlet: {inclusive (GST prices include GST), vatInclusive, composition,
 *            gstRegistered (false: no GSTIN, so no GST; true if left out),
 *            gstPaidByOperator (true: an app order, the app pays the GST),
 *            parcel (rupees), parcelGstRate (percent)}
 * returns, in rupees: {subtotal, offers, gst, vat, parcel, parcelGst, total, roundedTotal, roundOff}
 *   subtotal  the sum of the line amounts, as the menu shows them
 *   offers    what offers take off them
 *   gst, vat  all GST (the parcel charge's included) and all VAT on the bill
 *   total     what the guest pays before rounding to the rupee
 *
 * orders/tests/test_cart_tax_js.py runs this in Node against the real engine.
