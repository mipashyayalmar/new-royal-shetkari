# Media Storage & Database Backups (Cloudflare R2)

> Operational runbook. Media (logos, menu images) and DB backups both live on
> **Cloudflare R2** — chosen over AWS S3 because R2 has **zero egress fees**
> (free downloads) plus a 10 GB free tier.

## 1. The two buckets — and the one rule that matters

| Bucket | Visibility | Holds | Served via |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rasova-media` | **PUBLIC** | logos, menu images | `https://media.rasova.net/...` (custom domain, CDN-cached) |
| `rasova-backups` | **PRIVATE** | `pg_dump` database backups | nothing — API access only |

> ⚠️ **THE RULE:** media is public so images load in browsers. **Database backups
> must NEVER go in a public bucket** — a public DB dump is a full data breach.
> Keep `rasova-backups` private: no custom domain, no public dev URL.

---

## 2. How media works

```
User uploads a logo in Setup
        │
        ▼
Django (S3Boto3Storage)  ──PUT──►  R2 bucket: rasova-media/tenant_logos/xxxx.jpg
        │
        ▼
tenant.logo.url  ─►  https://media.rasova.net/tenant_logos/xxxx.jpg
        │
        ▼
Browser loads it via the custom domain (Cloudflare CDN, free egress)
```

Every uploaded file (logos now, menu images, etc.) goes to R2 automatically — no
code changes needed per upload.

### Config — all env vars (in server `.env`)
```bash
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=rasova-media
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<32-char R2 access key id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<R2 secret>
AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://836c606fc06525ba405b92c49ff23845.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME=auto
AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=media.rasova.net
```
Driven entirely from `core/settings.py` (the `if _AWS_BUCKET:` block). If
`AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` is unset, it **falls back to local disk** (dev mode).

### Why we moved (the bug that started it)
In production (`DEBUG=False`) Django only serves `/media/` when `DEBUG=True`, and
WhiteNoise serves static files + `public/`, **not** `MEDIA_ROOT`. So locally-stored
uploads returned **404** on the live site. They also die if the server is replaced.
R2 fixes both **serving** and **durability**.

---

## 3. Database backups

Script: **`scripts/backup/backup_to_r2.py`** — `pg_dump → gzip → private R2 bucket → prune old`.
Streams the whole way through (`pg_dump` piped into `gzip` piped into R2 via
`upload_fileobj`, auto-multipart), no full-dump memory buffer and no upload
size ceiling — earlier versions buffered the entire dump in RAM and uploaded
via a single non-multipart PUT (R2's hard cap there is 5GiB), fine at today's
size, a silent failure waiting for the database to eventually grow into it.

### One-time setup
1. In Cloudflare R2, create bucket **`rasova-backups`** — leave it **PRIVATE**
   (no custom domain, no public dev URL).
2. (Optional) add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   R2_BACKUP_BUCKET=rasova-backups
   R2_BACKUP_RETAIN_DAYS=30
   ```

### Run it
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/rasova && .venv/bin/python scripts/backup/backup_to_r2.py
```

### Automate it (nightly 2am)
```bash
crontab -e
# add:
0 2 * * * cd /home/ubuntu/rasova && .venv/bin/python scripts/backup/backup_to_r2.py >> /home/ubuntu/rasova/logs/backup.log 2>&1
```

The script keeps the last `RETAIN_DAYS` (default 30) of backups and deletes older
ones automatically.

---

## 4. Restore from a backup ⟵ test this BEFORE you need it

```bash
# 1. List available backups
.venv/bin/python -c "
import boto3; from django.conf import settings; import django
django.setup()
s3 = boto3.client('s3', endpoint_url=settings.AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL,
    aws_access_key_id=settings.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    aws_secret_access_key=settings.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, region_name='auto')
for o in s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket='rasova-backups', Prefix='db/').get('Contents', []):
    print(o['Key'], o['Size'])
"

# 2. Download one (replace the date)
.venv/bin/python -c "
import boto3; from django.conf import settings; import django
django.setup()
s3 = boto3.client('s3', endpoint_url=settings.AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL,
    aws_access_key_id=settings.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    aws_secret_access_key=settings.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, region_name='auto')
s3.download_file('rasova-backups', 'db/rasova_2026-06-11_0200.sql.gz', '/tmp/restore.sql.gz')
print('downloaded')
"

# 3. Restore into a database (DANGER: overwrites — restore into a fresh/spare DB first to verify)
gunzip -c /tmp/restore.sql.gz | psql -h localhost -U rasova rasova
```

> A backup you've never restored is a hope, not a backup. Do a restore drill once.

## 4b. WAL archiving — closing the "up to 24 hours lost" gap

The nightly `pg_dump` above only ever gives you last night's data. If the
server dies at 1:59am, the day's orders since 2am yesterday are gone. WAL
(Write-Ahead Log) archiving fixes that by continuously streaming every
change to R2, not just once a night — see the ELI5 walkthrough in
`md_files/` for the full explanation with the code annotated line by line.

**Three moving parts**, all already in `scripts/`:

| Script | Runs | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `archive_wal_to_r2.py` | Automatically, by Postgres itself | Ships each finished WAL segment to `rasova-backups/wal/` |
| `base_backup_to_r2.py` | Weekly, cron | Full physical snapshot to `rasova-backups/base/` — the anchor WAL gets replayed on top of |
| `restore_wal_from_r2.py` | Only during a recovery | Fetches archived WAL segments back, on demand |

> **Verified 2026-09-19** via a real Docker drill (throwaway Postgres 16, real base
> backup, real WAL archiving, real point-in-time restore): the mechanism works exactly
> as documented below, data committed before the target time survives, data committed
> after does not, down to individual-transaction precision. The drill also caught a real
> bug before it ever reached this server: the archive destination was owned by root with
> no write access for the `postgres` OS user, so archiving failed silently on every
> single attempt while WAL piled up locally, undetected. **This is exactly the failure
> mode `check_wal_archiving_health.py` (below) exists to catch** — confirm step 3 below
> passes before trusting this is actually running, don't assume it's working just
> because you didn't see an error.

### One-time server setup

`deploy.sh` now automates steps 0a and 0b below on every deploy (idempotent,
safe to re-run). Everything from step 1 onward is still manual, on purpose,
since it requires a Postgres restart. This exact sequence, in this exact
order, is what actually worked end to end on the real server — every step
here was a real failure caught and fixed live, not a guess.

0. **Permissions, before touching any config** (`deploy.sh` does this automatically now,
   included here for a fresh machine that hasn't run it yet, or manual reference):
   ```bash
   # a) postgres needs to reach the app dir at all — /home/ubuntu is 750 by
   #    default, which silently blocks postgres (neither owner nor in the
   #    ubuntu group) from even traversing into it. Execute-only, not a
   #    broader chmod — lets postgres reach a path it already knows without
   #    being able to list anything else in there (.ssh/, shell history, etc).
   sudo setfacl -m u:postgres:x /home/ubuntu

   # b) postgres also needs to WRITE into logs/ — django.setup() (needed to
   #    read the R2 credentials from settings) also configures Django's own
   #    file logging, which opens pos.log/django.log/errors.log/security.log
   #    immediately, whether or not the script ever logs anything through it.
   #    -R covers files that already exist; the -d (default ACL) line makes
   #    it apply automatically to new files too (log rotation creates new
   #    ones), so this doesn't have to be repeated after every rotation.
   sudo setfacl -R -m u:postgres:rwx /home/ubuntu/rasova/logs
   sudo setfacl -R -d -m u:postgres:rwx /home/ubuntu/rasova/logs

   # c) pg_basebackup connects using the app's normal DB role, which has no
   #    reason to hold replication access for anything else it does. Without
   #    this, base_backup_to_r2.py fails with "permission denied to start
   #    WAL sender". Replace rasova_user with the real DB user if different.
   sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER ROLE rasova_user WITH REPLICATION;"
   ```
   Full ELI5 on why the ACL approach specifically (not a broader chmod) is in
   `md_files/ELI5_ACL_PERMISSIONS.html`.

1. Add to `postgresql.conf` (path is usually `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf`):
   ```ini
   wal_level = replica
   archive_mode = on
   archive_command = '/home/ubuntu/rasova/.venv/bin/python /home/ubuntu/rasova/scripts/backup/archive_wal_to_r2.py %p %f'
   archive_timeout = 300
   ```
   `wal_level = replica` and `archive_mode = on` **require a full Postgres restart**
   (not just reload) to take effect — plan this for a quiet moment. `archive_timeout`
   alone can be applied with just `sudo systemctl reload postgresql` if set later.
2. Restart Postgres: `sudo systemctl restart postgresql`
3. Verify it took: `sudo -u postgres psql -c "SHOW wal_level; SHOW archive_mode; SHOW archive_timeout;"`
4. Watch it actually archive something — **check `pg_stat_archiver`, not the Postgres
   log**. Postgres only logs archive *failures*, never successes, so log silence after
   a fix looks identical to "still broken" and cost real time confirming this the hard way:
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT pg_switch_wal();"
   sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT archived_count, last_archived_wal, last_archived_time, failed_count, last_failed_time FROM pg_stat_archiver;"
   ```
   `last_archived_time` should be recent and *later* than `last_failed_time`. Also fine
   to eyeball the R2 dashboard's `rasova-backups/wal/` prefix directly for a new object.
5. Add the weekly base-backup cron (or just deploy — `deploy.sh` installs this too now):
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   # add:
   0 3 * * 0 cd /home/ubuntu/rasova && .venv/bin/python scripts/backup/base_backup_to_r2.py >> /home/ubuntu/rasova/logs/base_backup.log 2>&1
   ```
6. Run `base_backup_to_r2.py` once manually right now too — WAL archived before
   the first base backup exists is not useful on its own, you need the anchor.
   If this fails with `permission denied to start WAL sender`, step 0c above
   wasn't done yet or targeted the wrong role.
7. Add the health check to cron too (also in `deploy.sh` now), and actually watch it
   once before trusting it:
   ```bash
   */15 * * * * cd /home/ubuntu/rasova && sudo -u postgres .venv/bin/python scripts/backup/check_wal_archiving_health.py >> /home/ubuntu/rasova/logs/wal_health.log 2>&1
   ```
   Runs as `postgres`, not `ubuntu` — the local pg_wal check reads Postgres's own
   700-owned data directory, which `postgres` naturally has access to and no other
   account should (don't grant `ubuntu` access into Postgres's internals to "fix" this,
   that's the wrong direction of privilege). Confirm `archive_command` can genuinely run
   as the `postgres` OS user before walking away — permissions are the one failure mode
   that fails completely silently otherwise (see the drill note above). Check the R2
   bucket's `wal/` prefix directly after a few minutes, or just watch `wal_health.log`
   for the first "OK" line.

   This same health check also warns if total R2 backup storage (`db/` + `wal/` +
   `base/` combined) crosses `R2_STORAGE_WARN_GB` (default 8, out of R2's 10GB free
   tier). This is deliberately a warning, not an automatic deletion — the time-based
   retention above can't catch a genuine write-volume spike ballooning size *within*
   its own retention window, and pruning WAL more aggressively than the stated policy
   to compensate could silently strand an older base backup with nothing left to
   replay onto it. A size problem gets a human decision, not a silent policy change.

### Restoring to a point in time (not just "last night")

```bash
# 1. Stop Postgres
sudo systemctl stop postgresql

# 2. Clear the data directory and extract the latest base backup into it
#    (download rasova_base_<stamp>.tar.gz from R2 first)
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/<version>/main/*
sudo tar -xzf rasova_base_<stamp>.tar.gz -C /var/lib/postgresql/<version>/main/

# 3. Tell Postgres to recover, and how to fetch the WAL it needs
sudo touch /var/lib/postgresql/<version>/main/recovery.signal
# in postgresql.auto.conf:
restore_command = '/home/ubuntu/rasova/.venv/bin/python /home/ubuntu/rasova/scripts/backup/restore_wal_from_r2.py %f %p'
recovery_target_time = '2026-09-19 14:30:00'   # omit this line to replay everything available

# 4. Start Postgres — it replays WAL automatically, then comes up caught-up
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

## 5. Troubleshooting — "the logo / image isn't showing"

Work down this list:

1. **Is it saved?** `tenant.logo.url` should print a `https://media.rasova.net/...` URL
   (not `/media/...`). If it's `/media/...`, the R2 env vars aren't set / loaded.
2. **Is the file actually in R2?** Check the bucket in the Cloudflare dashboard, or
   open the `media.rasova.net/...` URL directly.
   - URL 404s but file *is* in the bucket → the **custom domain isn't Active**
     (R2 → rasova-media → Settings → Custom Domains → connect `media.rasova.net`).
3. **`Credential access key has length 0`** on upload → `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` is
   empty in `.env`. Add the R2 token keys; verify with:
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell -c "from django.conf import settings; print(len(settings.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID))"  # want 32
   ```
4. **Uploads silently go nowhere / hit AWS** → `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` missing, so the
   backend talks to real AWS S3 instead of R2. Set the R2 endpoint.
5. After changing `.env`, **restart gunicorn** so the web app re-reads it:
   `pkill -HUP -f 'gunicorn: master'`

## 6. Hosting note (AWS vs Cloudflare)

Cloudflare is **not** a place to run the Django app — it has no EC2-style VM for a
long-running Python + Postgres + Celery stack (Cloudflare = R2, DNS, CDN, SSL,
Workers/edge). So:

- **Storage / CDN / DNS / SSL → Cloudflare** (R2 done; DNS already on Cloudflare). ✅
- **The server (Django VM) → stays a VM** (AWS EC2 today, or a cheaper India VPS later).

The only thing we migrated to Cloudflare is what it's genuinely best at: **object
storage**. The compute stays on a real server.
