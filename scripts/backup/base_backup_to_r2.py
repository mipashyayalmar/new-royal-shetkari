"""
Take a full physical base backup of Postgres and upload it to R2.

Why this exists separately from backup_to_r2.py: that script's `pg_dump` is
a LOGICAL backup, a SQL script that recreates the data, fine on its own for
a plain restore, but WAL segments (see archive_wal_to_r2.py) are only
meaningful as changes applied ON TOP OF a physical copy of the real data
files. You cannot replay WAL against a pg_dump. This script produces that
physical copy, so a point-in-time recovery has something to start from.

Run weekly — WAL archives fill the gap between base backups, so the more
often this runs, the less WAL a future recovery has to replay:
