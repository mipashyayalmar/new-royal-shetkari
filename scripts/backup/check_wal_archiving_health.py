"""
Catch a stalled WAL archiver before it fills the server's disk.

Why this exists: Postgres will NOT recycle a WAL segment until archive_command
succeeds for it. If archiving stalls for any reason (R2 outage, rotated
credentials, a bug), segments just keep piling up in pg_wal on the server's
own disk instead. This box is a small, already-tight t3.micro (see the infra
notes), so "archiving quietly broke three days ago" is a real way this server
could actually run out of disk and stop accepting writes, not a theoretical
risk. This script checks Postgres's own bookkeeping (`pg_stat_archiver`) plus
the actual pg_wal directory, and exits non-zero the moment something looks off.

Three independent signals, on purpose — either one alone can miss things:
  1. `pg_stat_archiver`: Postgres's own record of when it last successfully
     archived a segment, and when it last failed. Precise, but only reflects
     what Postgres itself has tried, not what's piling up on disk right now.
  2. Raw pg_wal directory size: a direct, Postgres-independent check on the
     thing that actually threatens the disk.
  3. Total R2 storage used: the time-based retention in base_backup_to_r2.py
     (delete anything older than RETAIN_WEEKS) doesn't protect against a
     genuine write-volume spike ballooning size WITHIN that window. This is
     deliberately a WARNING, not an auto-delete — pruning WAL more
     aggressively than the stated retention window to save space could
     silently strand an older base backup with no WAL left to replay onto
     it, breaking the exact recovery guarantee this system exists for. A
     size problem gets a human's attention, not a silent policy change.

Run this on a schedule and read its output/exit code, it does not send an
alert on its own (no email/Slack wired up — that's a separate decision).
Runs as `postgres`, not `ubuntu` — the local pg_wal check reads Postgres's
own data directory, which is 700-owned by postgres and correctly not
readable by any other account, `postgres` already has natural access to
its own files, no extra grant needed:
