    Ensures the request user has a tenant and outlet assigned,

    platform superuser normally has tenant=None (they aren't scoped to any
    one restaurant), so the "must have a tenant/outlet" and "subdomain must
    match your tenant" checks would otherwise lock them out of any view
    stacked with this decorator, including views that already have their
    own explicit superuser tenant-selection logic (e.g. reports.dashboard's
    ?tenant_id=). Views that need real tenant/outlet data for a superuser
    to actually do anything must resolve that themselves, same as they
