class SearchIndexingMiddleware:

    Decides which pages search engines may index. Sits before WhiteNoise,
    because WhiteNoise serves the marketing pages (public/) on every host,
    so spice.rasova.net/compare/ (and any made-up subdomain) was a copy of
    rasova.net/compare/, and Google indexed the copy instead of the real
    one. It had also indexed rasova.net/login/, since nothing said not to.

    Indexing is opt-in: only the marketing pages on the main site and the
    guest menu on a restaurant's own subdomain are indexable. Every other
    HTML page gets "X-Robots-Tag: noindex". The header (not robots.txt) is
    the right tool here: a Disallow in robots.txt stops Google reading the
    page, so it never sees the noindex and can keep the URL indexed.

    On subdomains, the marketing page /compare/ moves to the main site with
    a 301, and www moves entirely. The home page stays on subdomains (staff
    open their own subdomain to reach login), it is only marked noindex.
