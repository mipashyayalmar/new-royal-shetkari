    """
    Retrieves and structures the active KOT batches for the kitchen display.

    Deliberately does NOT restrict to order__status__in=["open", "billing"]
    -- that was correct for fine dining, where kitchen prep always happens
    before the bill is paid, but token (QSR/cafe) orders are the opposite:
    pay_order fires the KOT and immediately closes the order in the same
    request, so by the time anyone loads this screen the order is already
    "paid"/"closed" even though the kitchen hasn't prepared anything yet.
    Filtering on order status here excluded exactly the orders the kitchen
    most needed to see. What actually determines whether a KOT belongs on
    this screen is whether it still has unresolved items, which the
    per-item exclude(status__in=["served","voided"]) below already
    handles -- a KOT whose items are all done naturally produces an empty
    `items` list and gets skipped. Cancelled orders are excluded here as
    an explicit belt-and-braces measure (cancel_order already voids their
    non-served items, which the per-item filter would exclude anyway).

    Token orders get one extra rule dine-in orders deliberately don't:
    mark_token_collected ("Picked Up") already moves their items to
    "served", which is enough on its own when staff remember to tap it --
    but if they don't, a token order has no other path off this screen,
    since there's no waiter-serve step to fall back on. Once an order's
    been ready for more than _KDS_TOKEN_STALE_MINUTES, it's dropped here
    as a safety net, same cutoff the guest-facing pickup board already
    uses to assume "probably collected, stop cluttering the screen". This
    does NOT apply to dine-in/table orders -- a plated dish waiting under
    a heat lamp for a waiter isn't on a clock, and shouldn't vanish from
    the kitchen's own view of it just because time passed.

    The "still has unresolved items" rule is applied in the database, not
    in the loop. This used to load every KOT the outlet had ever had and
    then call kot.items.exclude(...) per KOT, which skips the prefetch:
    one query per KOT in history, plus one per item for its menu name. The
    screen polls every 5 s, and a load test measured about 1.1 ms per past
    KOT (1,000 KOTs = about 1 s per poll, 10,000 = about 12 s), so the
    kitchen display got slower every day a restaurant used it. Now it is
    two queries (KOTs with open items, then those items with their menu
    item) however long the history is.
