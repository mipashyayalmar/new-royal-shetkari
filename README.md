## What Is Rasova

Rasova is a full-stack restaurant management platform built for Indian restaurants - fine dining, QSR counters, and cafés. It handles the complete order lifecycle: table management, kitchen tickets, billing, thermal printing, inventory, reports, and an order history with a full audit trail.

Two things that make it different from existing Indian POS software:

1. **AI menu import** - photograph any printed or handwritten menu → Gemini AI imports all items, categories, and prices in under 60 seconds. No manual data entry.
2. **Design** - built to look good. The billing screen, kitchen display, and QR menu are all significantly cleaner than Petpooja or POSist.

---

## Restaurant Types Supported

| Type | Key features |
|---|---|
| **Fine Dining** | Floor plan, table merge/transfer, waiter calls, kitchen display, split bill |
| **QSR / Fast Food** | Token counter, single-printer strip (bill + KOTs on one slip), pay-first flow |
| **Café** | Mix of both - floor plan + token system |

Each type gets its own default feature set. Owners and superusers can override individual features per outlet.

---

## Features

### Core POS
- Live floor plan with colour-coded table states (Free → Ordering → Preparing → Served → Billing → Cleaning)
- Section grouping on floor map with urgency highlighting (orange > 15min, red > 30min)
- Multi-item orders with modifiers, notes, and item-level discounts
- KOT (Kitchen Order Ticket) system with concurrency-safe numbering (`select_for_update`)
- Live kitchen display - item status tracking (Preparing → Ready → Served → Bumped)
- Table merge, unmerge, and order transfer between tables
- Waiter call via QR - rate-limited to one call per 60 seconds per table
- Kitchen messages to waiter - "Delayed 15 mins", custom messages, scoped per waiter

### QSR Counter Mode
- Token ordering - sequential daily tokens with automatic assignment
- Pay-first flow - cashier collects payment, then slip prints
- **QSR strip printing** - bill + all KOTs print as one connected strip (partial cuts between, final full cut)
- Auto-KOT at payment - for no-KDS setups, KOTs are created at payment time
- Auto-reset after payment - screen clears for next customer after 2.5 seconds

### Thermal Printing
- **Browser-based** - `window.print()` via OS print dialog, works with any printer that has a Windows driver. Zero local installation.
- **ESC/POS network** - direct TCP to printer at port 9100. Works via local Celery worker on the same LAN.
- **Strip mode** - QSR: receipt → partial cut → KOT 1 → partial cut → KOT N → full cut
- **Split mode** - Fine dining: bill = full cut (customer copy), KOTs = partial cuts (kitchen chain)
- SAC code (996331) printed on every bill - GST compliance
- GSTIN, FSSAI, address, and phone printed on header
- `python manage.py preview_print <order_id>` - see exact output without a printer

### Billing and Payments
- Split billing - multiple payment methods on one order
- Partial payments - collect in stages
- Split-bill QR accuracy - both the plain UPI QR and the Razorpay QR quote the actual amount being collected (a split share, not the full remaining balance), and the same corrected QR is what prints on the receipt
- Payment methods - Cash, UPI, Card (configurable per outlet), Razorpay UPI QR (dynamic, webhook-confirmed, supports quoting a partial/split amount)
- Offline cash payments - a bill can be closed and paid in cash with no internet connection; queues locally and syncs automatically once reconnected
- Discounts - percentage or flat, at order or item level (manager/owner only)
- Complimentary items - mark individual items as ₹0
- Refunds - two-level approval (manager/owner required)
- GST-compliant bills - per-item GST rates, CGST/SGST split, GSTIN, FSSAI, SAC code
- Thermal receipt page - `/thermal-receipt/<id>/` auto-prints via browser

### Order History
- Searchable, filterable list of all past orders - `/history/`
- Filters: date range, status, payment method, source, staff, free-text search
- Role-scoped: owner = all orders, cashier = 30 days, waiter = today only
- Slide-in detail panel: items (including voided with reasons), payments, audit trail
- Full audit trail - who voided what, who applied discounts, when order was paid
- CSV export (owner/manager only, max 2,000 rows per export)
- Handles: deleted menu items, split payments, refunds, complimentary orders, QR orders

### Inventory
- Real-time stock deduction on KOT send
- Recipe management - link ingredients to menu items
- Low stock alerts with configurable thresholds
- Purchase orders

### Ordering
- QR self-ordering - customer scans → views menu → places order → appears for staff approval
- Live order status for guests - a floating status button on the QR menu opens a slide-up sheet with a Received → Preparing → Ready → Served timeline, polling automatically until the order is done
- AI menu importer - photograph any menu format → imported via Gemini AI
- Aggregator webhooks - Zomato/Swiggy order ingestion with HMAC signature verification and idempotency

### Reports
- Daily and hourly sales
- Item and category performance
- Kitchen and waiter performance
- Payment method breakdown
- Dashboard metrics (owner view with live auto-refresh)

### Multi-tenancy and Access Control
- Every DB query scoped to `tenant + outlet` - zero cross-restaurant data leakage
- Feature flags per tenant type (fine dining / QSR / café) with per-outlet overrides
- Role-based access: Owner, Manager, Cashier, Waiter, Chef
- **Superuser control panel** - `/superuser/` - create restaurants, configure printers, apply feature presets, manage staff. No Django admin needed for setup.
- 24 configurable feature flags - toggle per restaurant without code changes

### Background Tasks (Celery + Redis)
- Thermal printing is async - payment response returns in ~12ms, printer runs in background
- Task idempotency - Redis key prevents double-printing on task retry
- Worker isolation - `RASOVA_TENANT_ID` + `RASOVA_OUTLET_ID` env vars scope each local worker to one restaurant
- Graceful fallback - if Redis is unreachable, falls back to synchronous print

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL 16
- Redis (for Celery) - `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine`
- Git

### System Requirements

| | Minimum | Recommended (production) |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | 1 vCPU | 2 vCPU |
| RAM | 1 GB | 2 GB+ |
| Disk | 10 GB | 20 GB+ (grows with order history + media) |
| DB | PostgreSQL 16, co-located or managed | PostgreSQL 16, managed (RDS or equivalent) if budget allows |
| Cache/queue | Redis 7 | Redis 7 |

Production today runs on a **1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM** instance (AWS t3.micro) with Postgres, Redis, gunicorn (`--workers 2 --threads 4`), and a Celery worker all co-located on the same box — this is the *minimum* row above, not the recommended one, and it's genuinely tight: little headroom before swap kicks in under real concurrent load. Per-gunicorn-worker memory measured directly under sustained load (see [`LOAD_TESTING.md`](docs/LOAD_TESTING.md)'s soak test) sits around 90-105 MB; with 2 workers that's already 200 MB+ before Postgres, Redis, Celery, and the OS itself are accounted for.

**Recommended minimum for production** is a **2 vCPU / 2 GB RAM** instance (e.g. AWS t3.small) — enough headroom for the current gunicorn config plus Postgres/Redis/Celery without relying on burst CPU credits or swap. Scale up further (2 vCPU / 4 GB, e.g. t3.medium) if adding more tenants, increasing `--workers`/`--threads`, or increasing Celery concurrency.

These figures come from the app's own configuration and measured per-process footprint, not from live production monitoring (no SSH-based metrics collection is wired up yet). Before committing to a resize, use the load-testing tooling in [`LOAD_TESTING.md`](docs/LOAD_TESTING.md) — specifically a soak test run directly on whichever instance size you're evaluating — to get a real, current answer rather than an estimate.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mipashyayalmar/new-royal-shetkari.git royal-shetkari
cd rasova

python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # edit with your values
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

### Run Everything (3 terminals)

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Django
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

# Terminal 2 - Celery worker (background printing)
celery -A core worker --loglevel=info -Q printing,default

# Terminal 3 - Redis (if not running as a service)
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` → log in as superuser → go to `/superuser/` to create your first restaurant.

**Alternative: Docker Compose** - `docker-compose up` brings up Postgres, Redis, the web server, and both a Celery worker and Celery beat (needed for the app's scheduled tasks) in one command, reading config from `.env`. This is a local/dev convenience, not how production is actually deployed - see [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md) for the real EC2 runbook.

### Preview Printing Without a Printer

```bash
python manage.py preview_print --list          # show recent orders
python manage.py preview_print <order_id>      # fine-dining mode
python manage.py preview_print <id> --strip    # QSR strip mode
python manage.py preview_print <id> --width 32 # 58mm paper
```

## Backups and Media Storage

Media (logos, menu images) and database backups both live on Cloudflare R2, in two separate buckets: one public for media, one private for backups.

- **Nightly dump** - `scripts/backup/backup_to_r2.py` streams a gzip-compressed `pg_dump` straight to the private bucket, with flat memory use and no size ceiling. 30 days are kept by default.
- **Point-in-time recovery** - Postgres ships every finished WAL segment to R2 (`archive_wal_to_r2.py`), and a weekly physical base backup (`base_backup_to_r2.py`) is the anchor those segments replay onto. A server failure no longer loses up to a day of orders.
- **Health check** - `check_wal_archiving_health.py` runs every 15 minutes: the archiver's own status, any backlog of unarchived WAL on disk, and total R2 usage against the free tier.
- **Restore** - `restore_wal_from_r2.py` fetches segments during a recovery, and `restore_drill.py` rehearses a restore into a throwaway database. Practise it before you need it.

Bucket setup, the one-time server steps, the restore procedure and troubleshooting are in [`docs/MEDIA_AND_BACKUPS.md`](docs/MEDIA_AND_BACKUPS.md).

---

## Thermal Printing Architecture

Rasova supports two printing modes:

**Browser printing** (zero local installation):
```
Browser → window.print() → OS print dialog → select printer → prints
Requires: printer driver installed on the cashier's computer
Works with: USB or LAN printers that have Windows/Mac drivers
```

**ESC/POS via local Celery worker** (full control):
```
Cloud Django → Redis → Local Celery worker → TCP:9100 → Printer
Requires: one always-on device on the restaurant LAN (Raspberry Pi, spare laptop)
Works with: any ESC/POS network printer (LAN port required)
```

For QSR with a single counter printer - both bill and KOTs print together as one strip, customer carries it to the food counter.

---

## Management Commands

```bash
# Printing
python manage.py preview_print --list
python manage.py preview_print <order_id> --strip --width 40

# Data and testing
python manage.py seed_restaurant          # seed test data
python manage.py test_pos_flow            # run the full POS flow
python manage.py simulate_restaurant_rush # stress test concurrency
python manage.py audit_pos                # check data integrity
python manage.py reset_pos                # clear POS data (dev only)

# Load testing (concurrency correctness + HTTP capacity + sustained soak test)
python manage.py load_test                # see docs/LOAD_TESTING.md for the full guide
python manage.py http_rush_test --host http://127.0.0.1:8000

# Public live demo (/live-demo/) -- idempotent, safe to run any time.
# Runs automatically every 2 hours via Celery beat; use by hand to reset
# on demand instead of waiting for the next scheduled run.
python manage.py reset_demo_tenant
```

Full guide to what each load-test phase checks and how to read its output: [`LOAD_TESTING.md`](docs/LOAD_TESTING.md).

---

## Tests

**1,360 tests across the codebase. All passing.**

```bash
python manage.py test --keepdb                           # all tests
python manage.py test orders.tests.test_critical         # critical paths
python manage.py test orders.tests.test_financial_flows  # payment flows
python manage.py test accounts tenants setup menu        # individual apps
```

Test coverage includes:
- Financial accuracy (Decimal math, GST rounding, no float bugs)
- Tenant isolation (cross-restaurant data access blocked)
- Role-based access (waiter cannot pay; a cashier or captain discounts only up to the outlet's staff limit, needs a reason for every manual discount, and cannot close a bill without payment)
- Concurrency (double-payment race condition, KOT number uniqueness under load)
- Celery task idempotency (print job cannot fire twice)
- API endpoints (notification, kitchen data, tables data)
- Feature flag logic (defaults + overrides per tenant type)

---

## Architecture Notes

### Multi-Tenancy
Every DB query is scoped by `tenant + outlet`. `TenantMiddleware` resolves the tenant from the logged-in user. `@tenant_required` enforces isolation on every view. A bug cannot accidentally expose one restaurant's data to another.

### Financial Integrity
All payment operations use `select_for_update()` to prevent race conditions. `Decimal` arithmetic throughout - no float math on money. Refund rows excluded from payment validation. KOT numbers use `select_for_update()` on `DailyKOTCounter` to guarantee uniqueness under concurrent load.

### Printing Isolation
Each local Celery worker reads `RASOVA_TENANT_ID` and `RASOVA_OUTLET_ID` from environment. Tasks for other restaurants are silently skipped. Task idempotency keys in Redis prevent double-printing on retry. Tasks expire after 30 minutes - old print jobs are never processed.

### Service Layer
Business logic lives in `orders/services/` - 9 service modules, none of which know about HTTP. Views are thin: validate input → call service → return response.

---

## Security

- **Brute-force protection** - django-axes, 5 failed attempts → 1-hour lockout, correctly scoped per real visitor IP (see below)
- **Real client IP resolution behind Cloudflare + Nginx** - `core.utils.get_client_ip()` believes nginx's `X-Real-IP` only from a trusted proxy (`TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS`), and `CF-Connecting-IP` only when that address is Cloudflare's (`CLOUDFLARE_IP_RANGES`); `X-Forwarded-For` is never believed. Used by axes, rate limiting and the aggregator allowlist, so a caller reaching the server around Cloudflare can't pick its own IP.
- **Tenant isolation** - every query scoped, cross-tenant access raises 403
- **Role-based access** - `@role_required` decorator on all sensitive endpoints
- **Feature gating** - `@feature_required` - disabled features return JSON 403 (not HTML) for API calls
- **`@tenant_required` superuser bypass** - superusers (`tenant=None` by design) no longer get locked out of views stacked with this decorator
- **HMAC webhook verification** - Zomato/Swiggy webhooks sign `"<X-Timestamp>.<body>"` with the outlet's secret (`orders/services/aggregator_webhook.py`), checked with `hmac.compare_digest` before any order data is read; a timestamp more than 5 minutes off is refused, and a repeated order ID answers 200 with the existing order
- **CSRF** - Django middleware + `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` configured, cookie renamed (`csrftoken2`) to eliminate stale-duplicate-cookie collisions after a domain-scope change, and a custom `CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW` (`core.views.csrf_failure`) returns a friendly reload page for real navigation or clean JSON for fetch/apiClient calls, instead of Django's bare default 403
- **QR ordering is token-only** - `digital_menu()` used to also accept a plain `?table=<id>`, letting anyone enumerate table ids and receive that table's real secret `qr_token` with no scan required. Removed outright after confirming it had zero real callers.
- **Rate limiting** - `django-ratelimit` on public QR ordering endpoint (20 req/min per IP) and login (10/min)
- **Error tracking** - Sentry for production exceptions
- **Structured logging** - tenant/outlet context injected into every log record, including a dedicated `pos.security` / `logs/security.log` channel for CSRF and axes events

## Roadmap

**Done:**
- [x] Multi-tenant architecture with feature flags
- [x] Fine dining floor plan + QSR token counter
- [x] ESC/POS thermal printing + browser printing
- [x] QSR strip printing (bill + KOTs as one slip)
- [x] Celery + Redis async printing with idempotency
- [x] Superuser control panel for restaurant setup
- [x] Order history with audit trail and CSV export
- [x] SAC code (GST compliance) on all bills
- [x] AI menu import (Gemini)
- [x] 1,360 passing tests (financial, security, concurrency, business-date accuracy)
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD
- [x] Razorpay UPI QR - dynamic QR on the bill screen, auto-confirms via webhook, configured per outlet in Payment Methods setup
- [x] Offline write queue - orders placed during connectivity loss sync when back online (IndexedDB, `offlineQueue` in `templates/core/base.html`); extended to cash payment closure too (`offlinePaymentQueue`) - a bill can now be closed and paid in cash with no connection, and syncs once back online. UPI/card intentionally excluded - both require a live gateway round-trip to actually verify payment, which no client-side queue can fake without accepting an unconfirmed claim as real.
- [x] Real unit conversion across production capacity, COGS, inventory restore, and QSR deduction - previously four separate, silently-drifting implementations
- [x] Business-day-accurate reporting - every report (Z-report, owner dashboard, sales/item/category/table/kitchen/waiter breakdowns, inventory usage/wastage/cost, the tax-inspection view) now uses the outlet's actual business-day cutoff instead of a plain calendar date. A restaurant open past midnight no longer loses an entire evening's revenue from "today's" numbers.
- [x] Same fix applied separately to the actual CSV/Excel export layer (`export_services.py`) - a different module with its own independent date-filtering, missed in the first pass and caught by specifically re-auditing GSTR-1 for accuracy. GSTR-1 gets filed with the government, so this one mattered more than an internal report being off. 5 export functions fixed, each with a test proving the old code dropped a full evening's data.
- [x] Self-service staff account management - owner/manager can reset a locked-out staff member's password or deactivate/reactivate an account directly from the Staff page, no server access required. Deactivation force-ends any already-open session and preserves all historical shift/cash-session/order records rather than deleting them.
- [x] Mobile-responsive setup pages
- [x] GSTR-1 export - accountant-ready Excel report, B2CS sales plus the mandatory Table 12 HSN/SAC summary every GST filer needs regardless of turnover
- [x] Split-bill QR fix - the UPI and Razorpay QR codes on the bill screen used to always quote the order's full remaining balance even after a bill was split into per-person shares; both now quote the actual amount being collected, and the fix carries through to the printed receipt
- [x] Order status for QR-ordering guests - a floating status button + slide-up sheet with a live Received → Preparing → Ready → Served timeline, replacing a banner that used to sit under the header and push the whole menu down
- [x] Subscription billing - monthly invoices for restaurants with Razorpay payment links, delivered by WhatsApp and email
- [x] WhatsApp bill delivery - customer receipts and subscription invoices through Twilio or the Meta Cloud API
- [x] Self-serve live demo - `/live-demo/` signs a visitor into a seeded demo restaurant that resets every 2 hours
- [x] Point-in-time database recovery - WAL archiving plus weekly base backups to R2, with a 15-minute health check

**Next:**
- [ ] Celery task monitoring - see pending and failed print jobs in UI
- [ ] Automatic recurring charge for the subscription fee (UPI Autopay) - today each invoice goes out with a payment link and the restaurant pays it
- [ ] External security audit
- [ ] Full local-first offline deployment (running detached from the cloud for extended outages, not just brief drops) - a substantially larger undertaking than the write queue above, only worth it for restaurants with sustained multi-hour/day outages rather than occasional drops
